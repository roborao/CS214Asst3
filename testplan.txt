For this assignment we tested our code by first creating different test files. We then ran our server code on one system
and our client code on another. The client code would request to open close read and write these files that were stored 
on the server side system. As such, our client tester code referenced our network open/close/read/write methods much the 
same as if they had been local open/close/read/write methods. To test if our code was robust, we included empty files, as
well as files that did not exist, and tried to close the same file multiple times. In all cases our code performed as 
expected and we found no obvious errors.
